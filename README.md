# Poppy-Robotic-Arm

#### In this project, an open-source Poppy humanoid robotic hand was implemented to help in service robotics. The application was to brush the teeth by implementing a sequence for the hand to move on. The robotic hand is implemented both in software and hardware. The software consists of SIMSCAPE multibody in SIMULINK and MATLAB, and the hardware is designed and implemented using SOLIDWORKS and 3D printed using PLA-plus material and then actuated. Tests were performed on the robot including both open-loop testing and trajectory tracking to plan the motion of the hand or end-effector. The trajectory included 2 motions, forward and backward to brush teeth.
